# Investigating Netflix Movies (1990s Edition)

This project is a brief exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix's movie catalog from the 1990s. The goal was to examine movie durations and genre trends, focusing on short action films and common runtime patterns. This analysis was conducted as part of a data science learning journey using DataCamp's Datalab environment.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Filter the dataset to focus on **1990s movies only**
- Identify the **most common movie duration** during the decade
- Count the number of **short action movies** (less than 90 minutes)

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this analysis is [`netflix_data.csv`](./netflix_data.csv) and contains the following columns:

| Column         | Description                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| `show_id`      | Unique ID of the show              |
| `type`         | Type of content (e.g., Movie)      |
| `title`        | Title of the show                  |
| `director`     | Director of the show               |
| `cast`         | Cast members                       |
